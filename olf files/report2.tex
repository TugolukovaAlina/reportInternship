Independent and uniform sampling.

The goal is to perform sampling is such a way that samples are independent and distributed uniformly.

The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm allows to perform sampling uniformly. If we start random walk from arbitrary node with following transition probabilities pij then the distribution of Xn when n approaches infinity converges in distribution to uniform.
 
In order to count experimentally the mixing time I started the MH method from a fixed node
