So correlation can be both because of network structure and the fact that values of neighbors are correlated.

The same graph with different energy

energy almost equals to the energy of random field
1/2 energy
1/3
1/5
1/10

 
plot error with increasing number of participants.


for the same correlation (energy) plot try rds on different graph structures
(small-world)
