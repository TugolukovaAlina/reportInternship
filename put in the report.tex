\section{put in the report}

RDS is introduced by Heckathorn 1997.

Many papers try to warn rds users.
Some paper are studying how the violation of some assumptions can influence on the RDS estimates.

In \cite{gile2010respondent} is studied  the sensitivity to the procedure for selecting the seeds, sensitivity to respondent behavior, sensitivity to the with-replacement assumption.

In order to study we have random graphs where we have some parameters to change. We want the same with values.



IT is written in \cite{gile2010respondent} that V-H estimator outperforms S-H estimator.
